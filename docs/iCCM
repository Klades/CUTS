1. Overview of iCCM
---------------------------------------
iCCM, which is short for integrated CCM (iCCM), is a framework for
integrating third-party distributed middleware into CCM. Unlike existing
approaches that rely on direct integration at the implementation level,
or integration via CCM connectors, iCCM integrates third-party
distributed middleware at the servant-level. This is possible because
CCM servants serve as mediators between the outside world and the
component's implementation. iCCM therefore leverages this capability
and allows such interaction with the outside world be with any distributed
middleware technology---not just CORBA or CCM. The only challenge is
mapping third-party distributed middleware events to CCM events.

2. Starting an iCCM Project
---------------------------------------
Starting an iCCM project is very simple. We have provided a Python3
script that will generate all the skeleton code needed to build an
iCCM project that integrated with both CCM and the Deployment And
Configuration Engine (DAnCE), which is a tool and framework for
deploying CCM applications.

Just execute the following command:

  %> $CUTS_ROOT/bin/generate_iccm_project.py -n NAME -o GENDIR

where NAME is the name of your project and GENDIR is the directory
for the generated files. The NAME parameter cannot contain any spaces.
