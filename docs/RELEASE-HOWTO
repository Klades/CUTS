I. CUTS Modeling Tools for CoSMIC
---------------------------------------
To make a release build of the CUTS Modeling Tools for CoSMIC, you
must have Wix installed on your machine and your favorite version
of Visual Studio. You can download Wix from the following location:

  http://wixtoolset.org

Once you have installed with, just execute the following commands
to build the installer:

%> cd %CUTS_ROOT%\install
%> %ACE_ROOT%\bin\mwc.pl -type wix CUTS_CoSMIC.mwc
%> %ACE_ROOT%\bin\mwc.pl -type vc? CUTS_CoSMIC.mwc

where ? is the correct version of Visual Studio. Once the workspace
generation is complete, just open the solution file and build it. At
the end of the build process, CUTS_CoSMIC.msi will be available in
the install directory.

II. Releasing the source code
---------------------------------------
Releasing the source code requires updating several files with
new version information, tagging the repo, and then starting
a new ChangeLog. Here are the exact steps:

1. Update the version number in the following files:

  . $CUTS_ROOT/VERSION
  . $CUTS_ROOT/PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM

2. Gather list of changes since last release, and update

  . $CUTS_ROOT/NEWS

3. Add the following entry to ChangeLog using the standard ChangeLogEntry
   format:

   Updated release document for version release x.y.z.

4. Create tag of CUTS trunk as

   tags/CUTS-x.y.z

5. Move $CUTS_ROOT/ChangeLog to $CUTS_ROOT/ChangeLogs/ChangeLog-x.y.z
   and start a new ChangeLog in $CUTS_ROOT/ChangeLog

6. Create the first entry in the new ChangeLog, which should have only
   one change (i.e., the change from Step 5) with the following text:

   Tagging ChangeLog from previous version.

After completing the steps above, you can start committing changes to
CUTS that will go towards the next version! :-)
