          First phase of developing a test management application. So far
          it is able to start/stop test in a database. The next step is to
          allow it to deploy/teardown distributed applications.

          The newest addition to the workload generator family. This is
          a logger that associates log messages with a test number. It
          works in conjunction with the TestManager and TestLoggerClient
          interface.

        * cuts/java/LogPriority.java:
        * cuts/java/Logger.java:

          Removed these files.

        * cuts/java/jbi/deployment/NodeManagerImpl.java:

          The <location> tag in the deployment plan now refers to an
          alias. The alias maps to the name that a node manager is given
          when it is deployed.

        * etc/ANT/include/cuts.build:

          Added cuts.install.dir property, which contains the location of
          the install directory in CUTS.

        * install/jbi.bundler.build:

          Finish defining script that will build a tarfile for the
          CUTS JBI architecture.

          Bug fix where the node application did not implement the
          start () method. Now, which start () is invoked, all the clients
          are activated.

          The runtime portion of the deployment framework is complete. It
          is now possible to programmatically deploy clients onto multiple
          node and into multiple processes.

          Another snapshot of the deployment framework. I have resolved
          the problem below w.r.t. not being able to instantiate the
          ApplicationProcessImpl class. This had to do with specify
          the command-line parameters incorrectly.

        * cuts/cuts.java.build:
        * cuts/java/ProcessHandler.java:
        * cuts/java/ProcessStreamReader.java:

          Apparently, if you spawn an application using Runtime.exec (),
          you must get the input/error streams of the spawned process and
          empty them occassionally. So, these are some helper classes that
          given a process, it will empty their buffer so the spawned
          child application does not freeze.

          Checkpoint the deployment framework. Right now, the spawned
          application process register themselves, however, I'm having
          trouble creating the ApplicationProcessImpl class. There is
          something wrong with the CLASSPATH because it is not able
          to create the ConnectionManager that is needed by the clients
          to connect to the server.

        * ChangeLog
        * ChangeLogs/ChangeLog-0_0_0_1:

          This marks the first official beta release of the Component
          Workload Emulator (CoWorkEr) Utilization Test Suite (CUTS). This
          also marks the first birthday of CUTS. Happy 1st birthday CUTS,
          and may you have many more!! :-)
