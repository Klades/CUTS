          Apparently, if you spawn an application using Runtime.exec (),
          you must get the input/error streams of the spawned process and
          empty them occassionally. So, these are some helper classes that
          given a process, it will empty their buffer so the spawned 
          child application does not freeze.

          Checkpoint the deployment framework. Right now, the spawned 
          application process register themselves, however, I'm having 
          trouble creating the ApplicationProcessImpl class. There is
          something wrong with the CLASSPATH because it is not able
          to create the ConnectionManager that is needed by the clients
          to connect to the server.
