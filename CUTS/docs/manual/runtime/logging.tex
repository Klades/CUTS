\chapter{CUTS Logging Facilities}
\label{chap:logging}

This chapter discusses the CUTS logging facilities. These facilities
are designed to simplify collection of system execution traces in 
a distributed environment. Moreover, the facilities simplify partitioning
system execution traces with different tests. This therefore makes it
possible to execute multiple tests in the same environment while 
preserving data integrity. Finally, the logging facilities discussed in
this chatper are extensible via intercepters and highly configurable so 
they adapt to different application domains.
