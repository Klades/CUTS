\chapter{PICML Modeling Quick Reference}
\label{sec:modeling-quick-ref}

This section provides a quick reference to the modeling
environment. In particular, it focuses on key elements in 
PICML modeling language (\url{http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/cosmic}) 
so you do not spend much time and
effort trying to determine what elements you need to build
a CUTS model.

The layout of this section is as follows: each subsection
corresponds to a folder type under the root folder in a 
PICML model. Within each section, we then highlight the 
important elements, \textit{i.e.}, those that are used most
often. This does not necessarily mean you will not use elements
covered in the section. Finally, for each element, we explain
its purpose so you have a better understanding of its role 
in the model.

\section{Predefined Types}

Predefined types, \textit{e.g.}, integer, boolean, and string, 
are defined in the \texttt{PredefinedTypes} folder. When you 
add a new predefined type folder to the model, PICML will 
automatically populate it will all the predefined types it 
currently supports.

\section{Interface Definitions}

The \texttt{InterfaceDefinitions} folder is used to define the 
interfaces, complex data types, and components, of the distributed
system. This folder can contain only the \texttt{File} element
type, which represents a \textit{Interface Definition File (IDL)}
file. Within the \texttt{File} element, the following elements are 
the most import elements when constructing a model that is useable
by CUTS (listed in alphabetical order):

\begin{modelelement}{Aggregate}{0.2}{modeling/figs/aggregate.png}
The aggregate is similar to the structure construct (\textit{i.e.}, 
\texttt{struct}) in C and C++, or a tuple in dynamic languages. It 
contains members elements, which reference their data type (\textit{e.g.}, 
\texttt{String}, \texttt{LongInteger}, and \texttt{DateTime}). By
default, all members of the aggregate are considered public.

The following is a list of the aggregate's child elements that
are most important, which are discussed in this section: 
\texttt{Member} and \texttt{Key}.
\end{modelelement}

\begin{modelelement}{Component}{0.6}{modeling/figs/component.png}
The component is an abstraction that provides/\-requires 
a set of services or sends/\-receives events. This is determined by
the ports it exposes to the other components. The component can
also contain attributes, which are points-of-configuration that
whose value is determined at deployment time. In CUTS, the component 
is where you model application behavior for early integration
testing via emulation. 

The following is a list of the component's child elements that
are most important, which are discussed in this section: 
\texttt{ProvidedRequestPort}, \texttt{RequiredRequestPort},
\texttt{InEventPort}, \texttt{OutEventPort}, and \texttt{At\-tri\-bute},
and \texttt{Read\-onlyAt\-tri\-bute}.
\end{modelelement}

\clearpage

\begin{modelelement}{Event}{0.2}{modeling/figs/event.png}
The event is similar to an aggregate in PICML in 
that it is a collection of data types. It can also contain 
more complex definitions, which are currently ignored in
CUTS. The main difference is that an event is used to send
data between two components via their \texttt{InEventPort}
and \texttt{Out\-Event\-Port} ports. 

The following is a 
list of an event's child elements that are most important, 
which are discussed in this section: \texttt{Member}.
\end{modelelement}

\begin{modelelement}{InEventPort}{0.6}{modeling/figs/ineventport.png}
The \texttt{InEventPort} element is a child of the \texttt{Component}
element that represents a port for receiving events from other components.
It is a reference element that refers to any \texttt{Event} element in
the model.
\end{modelelement}

\begin{modelelement}{Key}{1.0}{modeling/figs/key.png}
The key is a child element of an aggregate element. It is
primarily used in DDS to define the key value(s) of a data
type. If you are using the DDS code generators in CUTS, then
you will definitely need to make use of this element. It
is the only way to ensure you DDS data type definitions
are complete.
\end{modelelement}

\begin{modelelement}{Member}{0.2}{modeling/figs/member.png}
The member is a child element of an aggregate and event. It
is a reference element that points to a members data type.
\end{modelelement}

\begin{modelelement}{Object}{0.7}{modeling/figs/object.png}
The object is representative of an interface
in a distributed system. It can also be thought of as
a remote interface. This means that the object can have
methods, which are invokable by other components. Currently,
CUTS does not associate any behavior with objects. 
\end{modelelement}

\begin{modelelement}{OutEventPort}{0.6}{modeling/figs/outeventport.png}
The \texttt{OutEventPort} element is a child of the \texttt{Component}
element that represents a port for sending events to other components.
It is a reference element that refers to any \texttt{Event} element in
the model.
\end{modelelement}

\clearpage

\begin{modelelement}{Package}{0.2}{modeling/figs/package.png}
The package element is representative of a 
namespace is C++ and packages in Java. It is an object
that provide scope hierarchy to the definition. The 
package contains the same elements as a file. This 
means the important elements discussed in this section
also apply to a package element. 
\end{modelelement}

\begin{modelelement}{ProvidedRequestPort}{0.6}{modeling/figs/providedrequestport.png}
The \texttt{ProvidedRequestPort} element is a child of the \texttt{Component}
element that represents a service that is provide by the parent component.
It is a reference element that refers to any \texttt{Object} element in
the model.
\end{modelelement}

\begin{modelelement}{RequiredRequestPort}{0.6}{modeling/figs/requiredrequestport.png}
The \texttt{RequiredRequestPort} element is a child of the \texttt{Component}
element that represents a service that is required by the parent component.
It is a reference element that refers to any \texttt{Object} element in
the model.
\end{modelelement}
