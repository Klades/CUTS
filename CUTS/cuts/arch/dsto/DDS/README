To date the DDS version of the DSTO examples will build only on
Linux. The implementation of DDS used in OpenSplice DDS version
4.1, which is open source. To run the example by hand:

(1) type 'ospl start'

(2) type './dds_driver -s $CIAO_ROOT/bin/ciao_componentserver'

After this process exits,

(3) type 'killall -9 ciao_componentserver'

(4) type 'ospl stop'

There is also a perl script, you'll notice it is also
Linux-specific, since it contains the killall call.
