ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

CUTS has been deeply influenced and improved by the following colleagues in 
my research group at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.

. Krishnakumar Balasubramanian <kitty at dre dot vanderbilt dot edu>
. James R. Edmondson <james dot r dot edmondson at vanderbilt dot edu>
. Hamilton A. Turner <hamilton dot a dot turner at vanderbilt dot edu>
. Will Otte <wotte at dre dot vanderbilt dot edu>
. Jules White <jules at dre dot vanderbilt dot edu>

I would also like to thank all the following people who have also
contributed to CUTS over the years:

. Steve Baker <Steven_D_Baker at raytheon dot com>

I would particularly like to thank John M. Slaby, who was my supervisor
at Raytheon in Portsmouth, RI during the summers of 2005 and 2006. John
was the personal investigator (PI) of the project that gave birth to 
CUTS and has been instrumental in advocating CUTS to many stakeholders
to ensure our vision becomes reality!!

In conclusion, our goal is to see CUTS continue to evolve and become a more 
comprehensive, robust, and well-documented model-driven system execution 
modeling and integration tool suite for distributed systems that is freely 
available to researchers and developers.  If you have any improvements,
suggestions, and or comments, we'd like to hear about it.  Please see 

  $CUTS_ROOT/PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM

for instructions on submitting suggestions or fixes.

        Thanks,
