README

This folder normally contains a file named something like auto_generated.xml
This file is updated every time a chart is graphed - it is where the temporary 
xml is stored for that chart. Because this became a problem with SVN always
thinking I had made local modifications to this file, I have chosen to have it 
be ignored and just included a typical sample here. 

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?> 
- <chart>
- <chart_data>
- <row>
  <null /> 
  <string>1</string> 
  </row>
- <row>
  <string>result</string> 
  <number>0.5833</number> 
  </row>
  </chart_data>
  </chart>
